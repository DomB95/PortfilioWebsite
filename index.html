            <p>Hi, I'm <span>Dominique Burns</span>.
                a passionate and versatile Software Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, mobile apps, and game design. 
                My journey began when I helped a friend build a website, and that spark quickly grew into a full-fledged passion for coding. Since then, I've developed skills in languages like C++, C#, Java, Kotlin, and Python,
                and gained hands-on experience with frameworks and tools such as Flutter, Firebase, Unity, and .NET. I recently recieved my degree in Computer Science from Full Sail University, where I've built 
                projects ranging from portfolio sites to strategy games and mobile applications.
            </p>
            <p class="Read-More-Paragraph">
                I love creating user-focused digital experiences that blend design and functionality. Whether it's architecting backend systems or bringing UI mockups to life, I enjoy tackling challenges that make an impact. Outside of coding, 
                I'm always learning, from exploring game mechanics to picking up Spanish to learing to to play msuical instruments 
                and I'm driven by a desire to keep growing and building. My goal is to join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute, collaborate, and continue pushing my skills to the next level.
